# ðŸ–¹ .txt file conversion in the database ðŸ–¹

1. **Convert to CSV:**

   - Select specific text files from the 'data' folder to convert.
   - The application reads the selected text files and extracts relevant information from them.
   - It generates corresponding CSV files with the extracted data in the 'csv' folder.
   - The CSV files are formatted for easy integration with other applications and databases.

2. **Upload to SQL:**
   - After converting the text files to CSV, the application enables the user to upload the generated CSV files to a MySQL database.
   - The user is prompted to select the specific CSV files for upload.
   - The application creates or updates MySQL tables based on the selected CSV files.
   - Data from the CSV files is then inserted into the corresponding MySQL tables, making it accessible for various database operations.
